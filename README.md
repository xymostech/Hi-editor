## Hi
### An editor for weird people who like Haskell too much
==========

### Wtf is this?

This is me being very bored, as well as being mildly annoyed with both vim and
emacs, but in different ways. Obviously, the only solution to this problem is to
write my own editor. It will probably end up either being similar to vim with some emacs features, or it'll be scrapped when I get bored of it.

### Why Haskell?

Because Haskell is fun!
